During the winter of 2017/18, Beijing endured the longest consecutive dry day spell (CDD) (145 days; 23 October 2017–16 March 2018) since recordings began in 1951 (see Fig. 1b). There was no effective precipitation during this period, and there was no snow in the winter (November–February) for Beijing for the first time. As a result, the total precipitation was 86.3% below the observed average over North China Plain during 1960–2017 (see Fig. 1a), causing a severe drought and increasing the risk of wildfires. Starting in November 2017, El Niño–Southern Oscillation (ENSO) entered the La Niña phase and lasted until late April 2018. Couple...

**Abstract:**

In 2018, hailstorms accounted for three of the fourteen 2018 U.S. Billion Dollar Disasters: a June 6 2018 storm in Texas, and two Colorado hailstorms (June 18 – 19; August 6 – 7). What is the role of climate change in changing hail risk? Can current research methods address the space and time scales required to adequately assess hail risk? Can the available data distinguish between changes in storm frequency, changes in storm reporting practices, and changes in economic risk and our built environment? 2018’s billion dollar hailstorms have highlighted the limited capabilities of the scientific community to predict how climate change will impact hail storm risks, while raising concern about the vulnerability of society to these storms. Like any weather disaster, 2018’s hailstorms provide an ...

### Increased Dissolved Organic Carbon Concentrations in Peat‐Fed UK Water Supplies Under Future Climate and Sulfate Deposition Scenarios

**Authors:** J. Xu, P. J. Morris, J. Liu, J. L. J. Ledesma, J. Holden
**Journal:** Water Resources Research (None)
**DOI:** [10.1029/2019wr025592](https://doi.org/10.1029/2019wr025592)

**Matched Topics:** climate change
**Matched Fields:** environmental science

**Abstract:**

Peatlands are globally‐important terrestrial carbon stores as well as regional sources of potable water supply. Water draining from peatlands is rich in dissolved organic carbon (DOC), which can be problematic for water treatment. However, it is unclear how future climate and sulfate deposition changes may impact DOC in peatland‐derived potable water. The United Kingdom (UK) is a global hotspot that consumes 79% of all potable water derived directly from peatlands. Here, a physically‐based hydrological model and a biogeochemical organic carbon model were used to predict discharge and DOC concentration in nine hotspots of peatland‐derived potable water use in the UK under a range of 21st century climate and sulfate deposition scenarios. These nine catchments supply 72% of all peatland‐deriv...

### Snowmelt Detection with Calibrated, Enhanced‐Resolution Brightness Temperatures (CETB) in Colorado Watersheds

**Authors:** Mitchell T. Johnson, Joan Ramage, Tara J. Troy, Mary J. Brodzik
**Journal:** Water Resources Research (None)

**Matched Topics:** seasonal
**Matched Fields:** environmental science

**Abstract:**

Understanding the timing of snowmelt is critical for water resources management in snow‐dominated watersheds. Passive microwave remote sensing can be used to estimate snowmelt events through brightness temperature satellite observations. Previous studies were limited to lower resolution (~25 km or coarser) datasets, making it difficult to quantify snowpack variability in heterogeneous, high‐relief areas. This study investigates the use of recently available Calibrated, Enhanced‐Resolution Passive Microwave Daily EASE‐Grid 2.0 Brightness Temperature ESDR (CETB) to estimate snowmelt timing at much higher spatial resolution (~3‐6 km) than has been previously available. This study investigates the effectiveness of the CETB product for snowmelt detection in several locations in Colorado (North ...

**DOI:** [10.1029/2019wr025528](https://doi.org/10.1029/2019wr025528)

**Matched Topics:** river
**Matched Fields:** environmental science

**Abstract:**

Riparian zones are important buffer zones for streams as they are hotspots of nitrate transformation and removal in agricultural catchments. However, mixing of water from different sources and various transformation processes can complicate the quantification of nitrate turnover in riparian zones. In this study, we analyzed nitrate concentration and isotope data in riparian groundwater along a 2‐km stream section in central Germany. We developed a mathematical model combining end‐member mixing and isotope modeling to account for mixing of river water and groundwater and quantify nitrate transformation in riparian groundwater. This enabled us to explicitly determine the extent of denitrification (as process leading to permanent nitrate removal from riparian groundwater) and transient nitrat...

**Matched Topics:** seasonal

**Abstract:**

Observation‐based long‐term gridded snow water equivalent (SWE) products are important assets for hydrological and climate research. However, an evaluation of the currently available SWE products has been limited due to the lack of independent SWE data that extend over a large range of environmental conditions. In this study, three daily long‐term SWE products (Special Sensor Microwave Imager and Sounder [SSMI/S] SWE, GlobSnow‐2 SWE, and University of Arizona [UA] SWE) were evaluated by seasonal snow cover and land cover classifications over the conterminous United States from 1982 to 2017, using the historical airborne gamma radiation SWE observations (20,738 measurements). We found that there are similar patterns in SSMI/S and GlobSnow‐2 SWE when compared against the gamma SWE. However, ...

### A Data Censoring Approach for Predictive Error Modeling of Flow in Ephemeral Rivers

**Authors:** Quan J. Wang, James C. Bennett, David E. Robertson, Ming Li
**Journal:** Water Resources Research (None)
**DOI:** [10.1029/2019wr026128](https://doi.org/10.1029/2019wr026128)

**Matched Topics:** river
**Matched Fields:** environmental science

**Abstract:**

Flow simulations of ephemeral rivers are often highly uncertain. Therefore, error models that can reliably quantify predictive uncertainty are particularly important. Existing error models are incapable of producing predictive distributions that contain >50% zeros, making them unsuitable for use in highly ephemeral rivers. We propose a new method to produce reliable predictions in highly ephemeral rivers. The method uses data censoring of observed and simulated flow to estimate model parameters by maximum likelihood. Predictive uncertainty is conditioned on the simulation in such a way that it can generate >50% zeros. Our method allows the setting of a censoring threshold above zero. Many conceptual hydrological models can only approach, but never equal, zero. For these hydrological models...

### Seasonal evolution of active layer thaw depth and hillslope‐stream connectivity in a permafrost watershed

**Authors:** G. Chiasson‐Poirier, J. Franssen, M. J. Lafrenière, D. Fortier, S. F. Lamoureux
**Journal:** Water Resources Research (None)
**DOI:** [10.1029/2019wr025828](https://doi.org/10.1029/2019wr025828)

**Matched Topics:** river, streamflow, seasonal, surface water
**Matched Fields:** environmental science

**Abstract:**

To advance our understanding of permafrost hillslope drainage dynamics and its influence on streamflow hydrochemistry, we instrumented a hillslope‐stream sequence located in the headwaters of the Niaqunguk River watershed, Nunavut, Canada (63°N, 68°W). We combined high spatial resolution field measurements of water and frost tables across the hillslope, with semiweekly measurements of groundwater and streamflow chemistry to track the evolution of streamflow chemistry during active layer thaw. Interestingly, localized differential thaw patterns emerged under near saturation conditions across the instrumented hillslope, the result of a low‐frequency high‐magnitude summer rainfall event. Hillslope structure and uneven active layer thaw created two distinct fill‐and‐spill domains. A subsurface...

### An Empirical Reevaluation of Streamflow Recession Analysis at the Continental Scale

**Authors:** Arik Tashie, Tamlin Pavelsky, Lawrence E. Band
**Journal:** Water Resources Research (None)
**DOI:** [10.1029/2019wr025448](https://doi.org/10.1029/2019wr025448)

**Matched Topics:** hydrologic model, streamflow, drought
**Matched Fields:** geology

**Abstract:**

Streamflow recession analysis is a widely used hydrologic tool that uses readily available discharge measurements to estimate otherwise unmeasurable watershed‐scale properties, predict low flows, and parameterize many lumped hydrologic models. Traditional methods apply the simplifying assumptions of outflow from a Boussinesq aquifer, which predicts the slope of the recession curve relating streamflow to its derivative in log‐log space to decrease from early‐stage to late‐stage recession. However, this prediction has not been validated in actual watersheds. Also, recent studies have shown that slopes of observed recession events are often much greater than traditional methods that predict with data point clouds. We analyze recession behavior of 1,027 streams from across the continental Unit...

**Journal:** Water Resources Research (None)

**Matched Topics:** drought
**Matched Fields:** environmental science

**Abstract:**

The evolution of hydrological drought events is a result of complex (nonlinear) interactions between climate and catchment processes. To investigate such nonlinear relationship, we integrated a machine learning modeling framework based on the random forest (RF) algorithms with an interpretation framework to quantify the role of climate and catchment controls on hydrological drought. More particularly, our framework interprets a built RF machine‐learning model to identify dominant variables and visualize their functional dependence and interaction effects on hydrological drought characteristics utilizing concepts of minimal depth, interactive depth, and partial dependence. We test our proposed modeling framework based on a set of 652 continental United States catchments with minimal human i...

### Hydroclimate Change Encoded in Tree Rings of Fengshui Woods in Southeastern China and its Teleconnection With El Niño‐Southern Oscillation

**Authors:** Feifei Zhou, Keyan Fang, Fen Zhang, Zhipeng Dong
**Journal:** Water Resources Research (None)
**DOI:** [10.1029/2018wr024612](https://doi.org/10.1029/2018wr024612)

**Matched Topics:** climate change
**Matched Fields:** geography

**Abstract:**

Hydroclimate variations inferred from proxies, such as tree rings, provide a long‐term context for the understanding of the current climate change. In humid Southeastern China (SEC), relatively limited long‐term tree‐ring records were published due to the paucity of old trees. This study develops a robust tree‐ring width chronology from the Chinese cedar (Cryptomeria fortune) Fengshui woods, spanning from 1781 to 2015, by far the longest in SEC. Common growth anomalies of the Fengshui trees can well capture long‐term springtime (March–May) Standardized Precipitation Evapotranspiration Index (SPEI) changes over the past 230 years in SEC. This hydroclimate‐sensitive chronology shows significant correlations with El Niño‐Southern Oscillation (ENSO) like sea surface temperature modes, indicati...

**DOI:** [10.1029/2019wr026083](https://doi.org/10.1029/2019wr026083)

**Matched Topics:** streamflow

**Abstract:**

The flow duration curve (FDC) is effectively the cumulative distribution function of streamflow. For a long time, hydrologists have sought deeper understanding of the process controls on the shape of FDC, which has been a challenge due to contrasting processes controlling the fast flow and slow flow components of streamflow and their interactions. In this paper, we outline a new framework for exploring the process controls of the FDC, which involves studying fast and slow flow components of FDC separately and combining them statistically, explicitly accounting for their dependence. We illustrate the potential of the framework by constructing empirical fast flow duration (FFDC) and slow flow duration (SFDC) curves from the flow components obtained by traditional baseflow separation. Streamf...

**Matched Topics:** river, flood
**Matched Fields:** environmental science

**Abstract:**

The flow rate and the suspended sediment concentration (SSC) of two different rivers draining into the Adriatic Sea basin, the Secchia in Italy and the Devoll in Albania, were analyzed by processing the data collected in a 245‐day period at monitoring stations equipped with side‐looking acoustic Doppler current profilers (H‐ADCPs). SSC was determined as a by‐product of the echo profiles along the horizontal aligned acoustic beams emitted by H‐ADCPs. For the first time, the effect of organic matter other than a change of inorganic particles size distribution was evaluated as a possible reason for backscatter and attenuation variations during hydrological events. This reduced average deviations between acoustically inferred and sampled concentrations from 1 order of magnitude to 20% of actua...

**Matched Topics:** runoff
**Matched Fields:** environmental science

**Abstract:**

This study aims to isolate and quantify the role of shrinking glaciers in recent hydrological changes in eight watersheds in the southwestern Yukon (Canada) by using an original dual approach that consists of (i) watershed hydrological regime identification, followed by a trend analysis of discharge time series, and (ii) a model‐based peak water (PW) analysis using glacier cover change measurements. A distinction between hydrological regimes is a necessary add‐up to commonly used trend attribution methods as the lake runoff regime shares common characteristics with the glacier regime. Results show a link between shrinking glaciers and hydrological changes in the region, but the link is complex, and glacier retreat does not explain all the observed changes. Model outputs show that the two w...

**Matched Topics:** reservoir
**Matched Fields:** environmental science

**Abstract:**

The temperature of deep hydrothermal sedimentary reservoirs varies between 50 and 250 °C, while the temperature of injected CO 2 can be much below the reservoir temperature. Most past studies did not consider temperature effect on the CO 2 dissolution trapping in storage reservoirs. We have performed numerical simulations of coupled multiphase flow, solute, and heat transport for liquid/supercritical CO 2 injection in a storage reservoir for different reservoir temperature, injection temperature, and reservoir permeability. During the injection of relatively cool CO 2 in a warmer storage reservoir, brine density increases with CO 2 concentration causing solutal fingering in the diffusive boundary layer and the creation of an isolated dissolved CO 2 plume (gravity trunk) below the injection...

**Matched Fields:** environmental science

**Abstract:**

Flooding dynamics across a medium‐size (Janauaca Lake, 786 km2) floodplain system along the Amazon/Solimoes River over a 9‐year period (2006–2015) is studied through integration of remote sensing and limited in situ data in hydrologic‐hydrodynamic modelling based on Telemac‐2D model. Model accuracy varies through the hydrological year. We focus on seasonal and interannual spatial variability of water circulation and inundation duration. We highlight strong heterogeneities in water velocity magnitude between the different morphological domains of the floodplain, the highest velocities being encountered in the river‐floodplain channel. In addition to topography, we emphasize the importance of the main channel and the local runoff in controlling the water circulation, at least during part of ...

**Matched Topics:** river, streamflow
**Matched Fields:** environmental science

**Abstract:**

Model parameter calibration is a fundamentally important stage that must be completed before applying a model to address practical problems. In this study, we describe an automatic calibration framework that combines sensitivity analysis (SA) and an adaptive surrogate modeling‐based optimization (ASMO) algorithm. We use this framework to calibrate catchment‐specific sensitive parameters for streamflow simulation in the variable infiltration capacity (VIC) model with a 0.25° spatial resolution over 10 major river basins of China from 1960 to 1979. We found that three parameters—the infiltration parameter (B) and two of the soil depth parameters (D1, D2)—are highly sensitive in most basins, while other parameter sensitivities are strongly related to the dynamic environment of the basin.

**Abstract:**

Sandbars are ubiquitous in sandy‐braided rivers throughout the world. In the Great Plains of the United States, recovery and expansion of emergent sandbar habitat (ESH) has been a priority in lowland rivers where the natural extent of sandbars has been degraded. Recovery efforts are aimed at protection of populations of the interior least tern (Sterna antillarum) and piping plover (Charadrius melodus). But quantitative observations of deposition and erosion dynamics of populations of sandbars across long segments of rivers are rare. We present a three‐part case study which used Bayesian regression models to examine relations between hydrology, channel morphology, and ESH responses in the Platte River, eastern Nebraska. Logistic regression indicates presence of ESH is positively related to ...

**Abstract:**

Hydrological model calibration combining Earth observations and in situ measurements is a promising solution to overcome the limitations of the traditional streamflow‐only calibration. However, combining multiple data sources in model calibration requires a meaningful integration of the data sets, which should harness their most reliable contents to avoid accumulation of their uncertainties and mislead the parameter estimation procedure. This study analyzes the improvement of model parameter selection by using only the spatial patterns of satellite remote sensing data, thereby ignoring their absolute values. Although satellite products are characterized by uncertainties, their most reliable key feature is the representation of spatial patterns, which is a unique and relevant source of info...

**Matched Fields:** environmental science

**Abstract:**

Riverine dissolved inorganic carbon (DIC) exports play a central role in the regional and global carbon cycles. Here, we investigated the spatiotemporal variability and sources of DIC in eight catchments in the Yangtze River source region (YRSR) with variable permafrost coverage and seasonally thawed active layers. The YRSR catchments are DIC‐rich (averagely 25 mg C L−1) and export 3.51 g m−2 yr−1 of DIC. The seasonal changes of temperature, active layer, flow path, and discharge can alter DIC and stable carbon isotope of DIC (δ13C‐DIC). The most depleted δ13C‐DIC values were found in the thawed period, suggesting the soil‐respired CO2 during the active layer thaw period can promote bicarbonate production via H2CO3 weathering. Spatially, δ13C‐DIC values increased downstream, likely due to ...

**Abstract:**

An array of three horizontally mounted acoustic Doppler current profilers (ADCPs) deployed in the Fraser River at Mission British Columbia was used to calculate suspended sediment concentration (M), mean grain size (Dg), and geometric standard deviation σg of the grain size distribution (GSD) using acoustic signal inversion. We examine two different multifrequency methods, an explicit and implicit inversion, by systematically allowing M, Dg, and GSD standard deviation (σg) to vary in the inversions. This is the first application of these methods to commercially produced ADCPs, and we further develop methods that use both viscous and scattering attenuation. We couple these inversions with bottle samples collected within the ensonified volume that were analyzed for suspended sediment concent...

**Abstract:**

Recent studies have highlighted an increase of chloride in many lakes worldwide, with negative effects on chemical and physical properties of inland waters and freshwater biota. In this study, we assessed the long‐term trend (1993–2017) of chloride in Lake Iseo, located in the midlatitudes, and analyzed its relationship with discharge data of the inflows and hydrological and hydroclimatic changes. Additionally, we performed a specific annual survey, collecting water samples at a biweekly frequency in tributaries, calculating chloride load, and comparing the result with the chloride increase observed in lacustrine water. The combined use of Geographic Information System (GIS) and multivariate analyses allowed identification of possible sources of chloride and their seasonal dynamic within t...

**Abstract:**

As watershed management programs have become more common globally, so have efforts to support these initiatives through hydrologic modeling and monitoring. However, these efforts are often guided by oversimplified assumptions of how management programs work and the quantity, quality, and type of information needed to support their planning, implementation, and evaluation. Semi‐structured interviews and focus groups with project managers, funders, and participants in three watershed management programs in the Atlantic Forest of Brazil revealed a range of hydrologic modeling and monitoring needs of watershed management programs. We identify five opportunities for hydrologic information to support overlapping management contexts: (1) inspire action and support, (2) inform investment decisions...

**Matched Topics:** hydrologic model, reservoir, climate change
**Matched Fields:** environmental science

**Abstract:**

Climate and land cover change strongly shape water resources management, but understanding their joint impacts is extremely challenging. Consequently, there is limited research of their integrated effects on water supply systems, and even fewer studies that rigorously account for infrastructure investment and management interventions. We utilize ecohydrologic modeling to generate watershed outflows under scenarios of climate and land cover change, which in turn drive modeled water utility‐level decision making for the Research Triangle region of North Carolina. In the Triangle region, land cover and climate change are both likely to increase water supply availability (reservoir inflows) individually and in tandem. However, improvements from water supply increases are not uniform across man...

**Abstract:**

Rainfall‐runoff modeling is a complex nonlinear time series problem. While there is still room for improvement, researchers have been developing physical and machine learning models for decades to predict runoff using rainfall data sets. With the advancement of computational hardware resources and algorithms, deep learning methods such as the long short‐term memory (LSTM) model and sequence‐to‐sequence (seq2seq) modeling have shown a good deal of promise in dealing with time series problems by considering long‐term dependencies and multiple outputs. This study presents an application of a prediction model based on LSTM and the seq2seq structure to estimate hourly rainfall‐runoff. Focusing on two Midwestern watersheds, namely, Clear Creek and Upper Wapsipinicon River in Iowa, these models w...

**Abstract:**

The lag time between rainfall input and discharge output—that is, the response speed of a catchment—is a key parameter for flood prediction but is difficult to quantify. Here we propose a new method to quantify catchment‐wide average peak propagation speed in hillslopes based on measurements conducted in a steep 4.5‐km2 catchment. The peak lag time of the catchment was partitioned into lag times in the hillslope and channel. Peak propagation speed was calculated from flow path length divided by lag time. We verified the results and evaluated the applicability and uncertainty of this method. This method can be applied during intense storms with identifiable peak relationships between rainfall and discharge. The effect of spatial variation in precipitation was insignificant in the study catc...

**Matched Fields:** environmental science

**Abstract:**

Many mountainous and high‐latitude regions have experienced more precipitation as rain rather than snow due to warmer winter temperatures. Further decreases in the annual snow fraction are projected under continued global warming, with potential impacts on flood risk. Here, we quantify the size of streamflow peaks in response to both seasonal and event‐specific rain‐fraction using stream gage observations from watersheds across the western United States. Across the study watersheds, the largest rainfall‐driven streamflow peaks are >2.5 times the size of the largest snowmelt‐driven peaks. Using a panel regression analysis of individual precipitation and snowmelt events, we show that the empirical streamflow response grows approximately exponentially as the liquid precipitation input increas...

**Abstract:**

Subsurface flow dominates water movement from hillslopes to streams in most forested headwater catchments. Hewlett and Hibbert (1963, https://doi.org/10.1029/JZ068i004p01081) constructed an idealized hillslope model (0.91 × 0.91 × 15.0 m; 21.8°) using reconstituted C horizon soil to investigate importance of interflow, a type of subsurface flow. They saturated the model, covered it to prevent evaporation, and allowed free drainage for 145 days. The resulting recession drainage curve suggested two phases: fast drainage of saturated soil in the first 1.5 days and then slow drainage of unsaturated soil. Hydrologists interpreted the latter as evidence interflow could sustain baseflow, even during extended drought. Since that experiment, typical forest vegetation grew in the model, providing ro...

**Abstract:**

Modeling spatiotemporal dynamics of snow in forests is challenging, as involved processes are strongly dependent on small‐scale canopy properties. In this study, we explore how local canopy structure information can be integrated in a medium‐complexity energy balance snow model to replicate observed snow patterns at very high spatial resolutions. Snow depth distributions simulated with the Flexible Snow Model (FSM2) were tested against extensive experimental data acquired in discontinuous subalpine forest stands in Eastern Switzerland over three winters. While the default canopy implementation in FSM2 fails to capture the observed snow depth variability, performance is considerably improved when local canopy cover fraction and hemispherical sky view fraction are additionally accounted for ...

**Abstract:**

To date, there is no consensus on the probability distribution of particle velocities during bedload transport, with some studies suggesting an exponential‐like distribution while others a Gaussian‐like distribution. Yet, the form of this distribution is key for the determination of sediment flux and the dispersion characteristics of tracers in rivers. Combining theoretical analysis of the Fokker‐Planck equation for particle motions, numerical simulations of the corresponding Langevin equation, and measurements of motion in high‐speed imagery from particle‐tracking experiments, we examine the statistics of bedload particle trajectories, revealing a two‐regime distance‐time (L‐Tp) scaling for the particle hops (measured from start to stop). We show that particles of short hop distances scal...

**Matched Topics:** flood

**Abstract:**

Recent unprecedented events have highlighted that the existing approach to managing flood risk is inadequate for complex urban systems because of its overreliance on simplistic methods at coarse‐resolution large scales, lack of model physicality using loose hydrologic‐hydraulic coupling, and absence of urban water infrastructure at large scales. Distributed models are a potential alternative as they can capture the complex nature of these events through simultaneous tracking of hydrologic and hydrodynamic processes. However, their application to large‐scale flood mapping and forecasting remains challenging without compromising on spatiotemporal resolution, spatial scale, model accuracy, and local‐scale hydrodynamics. Therefore, it is essential to develop techniques that can address these i...

**Matched Topics:** runoff, streamflow
**Matched Fields:** environmental science

**Abstract:**

Runoff prediction in ungauged catchments is a significant hydrological challenge. The common approach is to calibrate hydrological models against streamflow data from gauged catchments, and then regionalize or transfer parameter values from the gauged calibration to predict runoff in the ungauged catchments. This paper explores the potential for using parameter values from hydrological models calibrated solely against readily available remotely sensed evapotranspiration data to estimate runoff time series. The advantage of this approach is that it does not require observed streamflow data for model calibration and is therefore particularly useful for runoff prediction in poorly gauged or ungauged regions. The modeling experiments are carried out using data from 222 catchments across Austra...

**Abstract:**

The annual timing of flood events is a useful indicator to study the interaction between atmospheric and catchment processes in generating floods. This paper presents an assessment of the seasonal timing of floods for 7,894 gauging locations across the globe over a common period from 1981 to 2010. The averaged ordinal date of annual maximum streamflow is then estimated for ungauged locations following a two‐stage prediction scheme. The first stage identifies regions that share a common climatic predictor of flood timing by analyzing the similarity of flood timing with seven climate variables. These variables represent precipitation timing and snowmelt dynamics and are derived from a global climate reanalysis data set. Homogeneous regions in terms of the dominant predictor are generalized i...

**Abstract:**

Understanding the atmosphere–land surface interaction is crucial for clarifying the responses and feedbacks of terrestrial ecosystems to climate change. However, quantifying the effects of multiple climatic factors to vegetation activities is challenging. Using the geographical detector model (GDM), this study quantifies the relative contributions of climatic factors including precipitation, relative humidity, solar radiation, and air temperature to the interannual variation (IAV) of the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) in the northern grasslands of China during 2000 to 2016. The results show heterogeneous spatial patterns of determinant climatic factors on the IAV of NDVI. Precipitation and relative humidity jointly controlled the IAV of NDVI, illustrating more explanatory po...

**Abstract:**

Moisture transport over the northeastern Atlantic Ocean is an important process governing precipitation distribution and variability over western Europe. To assess its long-term variability, the vertically integrated horizontal water vapor transport (IVT) from a long-term climate simulation spanning the period 850–2100 CE was used. Results show a steady increase in moisture transport toward western Europe since the late-nineteenth century that is projected to expand during the twenty-first century under the RCP8.5 scenario. The projected IVT for 2070–99 significantly exceeds the range given by interannual–interdecadal variability of the last millennium. Changes in IVT are in line with significant increases in tropospheric moisture content, driven by the concurrent rise in surface temperatu...

**Abstract:**

Three Gorges Dam (TGD), the world’s largest hydroelectric project in terms of installed capacity, alters the discharge and thermal regime of the Yangtze River in China, thereby threatening the aquatic biodiversity along the mid-lower Yangtze River. Thus, the influence of the TGD impoundment on the river temperature (Tw) and water cycle warrants in-depth examination. To the best of our knowledge, this study is the first to use decadal (2001–2013) Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer temperature data to assess the impacts of TGD impoundment on the inland water cycle. We found that (1) spatially, the multiyear Tw decreased by 5 °C along the mid-lower Yangtze River, (2) temporally, Tw exhibited a warming trend after the operation of the TGD began, with most warming occurring from Octo...

**Abstract:**

The impacts of hazard events such as extreme rainfall, heatwaves, and droughts are substantial and represent an increasing threat over India. Effective adaptations to these hazards require an in-depth understanding of their physical and socioeconomic drivers. While hazard characteristic models have been substantially improved, compelling evidence of the spatio-temporal analysis of social vulnerability (SoV) throughout India are still lacking. Here, we provide the first analysis of the SoV to disasters at a national-scale for the past two decades using a robust data envelopment analysis framework, which eliminates subjectivity associated with indicator weighting. An interesting result is that SoV has decreased over past decade, which is primarily due to an increase in literacy rate and conv...

As humanity’s demand for resources continues to rise and productive arable lands become increasingly scarce, many of Earth’s remaining intact regions are at heightened risk of destruction from agricultural development. In situations where agricultural expansion is inevitable, it is important to manage intact landscape transformation so that impacts on environmental values are minimised. Here, we present a novel, spatially explicit, land use planning framework that addresses the decision making needed to account for different, competing economic-environment objectives (agricultural production value, biodiversity conservation, ecosystem service retention) when land use change is inevitable within an intact landscape. We apply our framework to the globally significant savannahs of the Orinoqu...

**Abstract:**

Hydro-climatic extremes can affect the reliability of electricity supply, in particular in countries that depend greatly on hydropower or cooling water and have a limited adaptive capacity. Assessments of the vulnerability of the power sector and of the impact of extreme events are thus crucial for decision-makers, and yet often they are severely constrained by data scarcity. Here, we introduce and validate an energy-climate-water framework linking remotely-sensed data from multiple satellite missions and instruments (TOPEX/POSEIDON. OSTM/Jason, VIIRS, MODIS, TMPA, AMSR-E) and field observations. The platform exploits random forests regression algorithms to mitigate data scarcity and predict river discharge variability when ungauged. The validated predictions are used to assess the impact ...

**Abstract:**

In recent years, changing lifestyle, consumption and mobility patterns have contributed to a global rise in greenhouse gases responsible for the warming of the planet. Despite its increasing relevance, there is a lack of understanding of factors influencing the environmental behavior of people from emerging economies. In this study, we focus on the role of formal education for pro-environmental behavior in the Philippines and study three potentially underlying mechanisms explaining the education effects: differential knowledge about climate change, risk perceptions, and awareness. Whilst there is some evidence showing that education is associated with pro-environmental behavior, little is known about the actual mechanisms through which it influences decision-making.

**Abstract:**

Future changes in climate and socioeconomic systems will drive both the availability and use of water resources, leading to evolutions in scarcity. The contributions of both systems can be quantified individually to understand the impacts around the world, but also combined to explore how the coevolution of energy-water-land systems affects not only the driver behind water scarcity changes, but how human and climate systems interact in tandem to alter water scarcity. Here we investigate the relative contributions of climate and socioeconomic systems on water scarcity under the Shared Socioeconomic Pathways-Representative Concentration Pathways framework. While human systems dominate changes in water scarcity independent of socioeconomic or climate future, the sign of these changes depend p...

**Abstract:**

Merged multisatellite precipitation datasets (MMPDs) combine the advantages of individual satellite precipitation products (SPPs), have a tendency to reduce uncertainties, and provide higher potentials to hydrological applications. This study applied a dynamic clustered Bayesian model averaging (DCBA) algorithm to merge four SPPs across Pakistan. The DCBA algorithm produced dynamic weights to different SPPs varying both spatially and temporally to accommodate the spatiotemporal differences of SPP performances. The MMPD is developed at daily temporal scale from 2000 to 2015 with spatial resolution of 0.25° using extensively evaluated SPPs and a global atmospheric reanalysis–precipitation dataset: Tropical Rainfall Measurement Mission (TRMM) Multisatellite Precipitation Analysis (TMPA) 3B42V...

**Abstract:**

We evaluate the impact of Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment data assimilation (GRACE-DA) on seasonal hydrological forecast initialization over the U.S., focusing on groundwater storage. GRACE-based terrestrial water storage (TWS) estimates are assimilated into a land surface model for the 2003-2016 period. Three-month hindcast (i.e., forecast of past events) simulations are initialized using states from the reference (no data assimilation) and GRACE-DA runs. Differences between the two initial hydrological condition (IHC) sets are evaluated for two forecast techniques at 305 wells where depth-to-water-table measurements are available. Results show that using GRACE-DA-based IHC improves seasonal groundwater forecast performance in terms of both RMSE and correlation. While most regions...

**Abstract:**

The goal of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration’s (NOAA) Warn-on-Forecast (WoF) program is to provide frequently updating, probabilistic model guidance that will enable National Weather Service (NWS) forecasters to produce more continuous communication of hazardous weather threats (e.g., heavy rainfall, flash floods, damaging wind, large hail, and tornadoes) between the watch and warning temporal and spatial scales. To evaluate the application of this WoF concept for probabilistic short-term flash flood prediction, the 0–3-h rainfall forecasts from NOAA National Severe Storms Laboratory’s (NSSL) experimental WoF System (WoFS) were integrated as the forcing to the NWS operational hydrologic modeling core within the Flooded Locations and Simulated Hydrographs (FLASH) system. ...

**Matched Topics:** river
**Matched Fields:** environmental science

**Abstract:**

The water resources of the Chari River basin, contributing more than 90% of the water to one of the largest lakes in Africa, known as Lake Chad, are highly vulnerable to natural and anthropogenic changes. Therefore, the changes in water resources were predicted for the next 20 years (i.e., 2016–35) by using the harmonic regression model (HRM), one of the most sophisticated time series methods, and also projected under representative concentration pathways (RCPs) by using the multimodel approach for the periods 2021–50, 2051–80, and 2081–2100, with respect to the baseline period (1971–2001). The Tropical Rainfall Measuring Mission (TRMM), Climatic Research Unit (CRU), and dynamically downscaled climatic data were used in the analysis of the present study. The results showed that under MME-R...

### Patterns and Drivers of Atmospheric River Precipitation and Hydrologic Impacts across the Western United States

**Authors:** Christine M. Albano, Michael D. Dettinger, Adrian A. Harpold
**Journal:** Journal of Hydrometeorology (None)
**DOI:** [10.1175/jhm-d-19-0119.1](https://doi.org/10.1175/jhm-d-19-0119.1)

**Matched Topics:** river, runoff, flood
**Matched Fields:** environmental science

**Abstract:**

Atmospheric rivers (ARs) significantly influence precipitation and hydrologic variability in many areas of the world, including the western United States. As ARs are increasingly recognized by the research community and the public, there is a need to more precisely quantify and communicate their hydrologic impacts, which can vary from hazardous to beneficial depending on location and on the atmospheric and land surface conditions prior to and during the AR. This study leverages 33 years of atmospheric and hydrologic data for the western United States to 1) identify how water vapor amount, wind direction and speed, temperature, and antecedent soil moisture conditions influence precipitation and hydrologic responses (runoff, recharge, and snowpack) using quantile regression and 2) identify d...

### Can the GPM IMERG Final Product Accurately Represent MCSs’ Precipitation Characteristics over the Central and Eastern United States?

**Authors:** Wenjun Cui, Xiquan Dong, Baike Xi, Zhe Feng, Jiwen Fan
**Journal:** Journal of Hydrometeorology (None)
**DOI:** [10.1175/jhm-d-19-0123.1](https://doi.org/10.1175/jhm-d-19-0123.1)

**Matched Topics:** hydrology, seasonal
**Matched Fields:** environmental science

**Abstract:**

Mesoscale convective systems (MCSs) play an important role in water and energy cycles as they produce heavy rainfall and modify the radiative profile in the tropics and midlatitudes. An accurate representation of MCSs’ rainfall is therefore crucial in understanding their impact on the climate system. The V06B Integrated Multisatellite Retrievals from Global Precipitation Measurement (IMERG) half-hourly precipitation final product is a useful tool to study the precipitation characteristics of MCSs because of its global coverage and fine spatiotemporal resolutions. However, errors and uncertainties in IMERG should be quantified before applying it to hydrology and climate applications. This study evaluates IMERG performance on capturing and detecting MCSs’ precipitation in the central and eas...

### Aerosols in the E3SM Version 1: New Developments and Their Impacts on Radiative Forcing

**Authors:** Hailong Wang, Richard C. Easter, Rudong Zhang, Po‐Lun Ma, Balwinder Singh et al. (22 authors)
**Journal:** Journal of Advances in Modeling Earth Systems (None)
**DOI:** [10.1029/2019ms001851](https://doi.org/10.1029/2019ms001851)

**Matched Topics:** earth system model
**Matched Fields:** environmental science

**Abstract:**

The new Energy Exascale Earth System Model Version 1 (E3SMv1) developed for the U.S. Department of Energy has significant new treatments of aerosols and light‐absorbing snow impurities as well as their interactions with clouds and radiation. This study describes seven sets of new aerosol‐related treatments (involving emissions, new particle formation, aerosol transport, wet scavenging and resuspension, and snow radiative transfer) and examines how they affect global aerosols and radiative forcing in E3SMv1. Altogether, they give a reduced total aerosol radiative forcing (−1.6 W/m2) and sensitivity in cloud liquid water to aerosols, but an increased sensitivity in cloud droplet size to aerosols. A new approach for H2SO4 production and loss largely reduces a low bias in small particles conce...

### Parameterizing Perennial Bioenergy Crops in Version 5 of the Community Land Model Based on Site‐Level Observations in the Central Midwestern United States

**Authors:** Yanyan Cheng, Maoyi Huang, Min Chen, Kaiyu Guan, Carl Bernacchi et al. (7 authors)
**Journal:** Journal of Advances in Modeling Earth Systems (None)
**DOI:** [10.1029/2019ms001719](https://doi.org/10.1029/2019ms001719)

**Matched Topics:** runoff, land surface model, climate change
**Matched Fields:** environmental science

**Abstract:**

With projected expansion of biofuel production at a global scale, there is a pressing need to develop adequate representation of bioenergy crops in land surface models to help effectively quantify the biogeophysical and biogeochemical effects of its associated land use changes. This study implements two new perennial bioenergy crops, Miscanthus and switchgrass, into the Community Land Model Version 5 based on site‐level observations from the midwestern United States by modifying parameters associated with photosynthesis, phenology, allocation, decomposition, and carbon cost of nitrogen uptake and integrating concomitantly land management practices. Sensitivity analyses indicate that carbon and energy fluxes of the perennial crops are most sensitive to photosynthesis and phenology parameter...

### Initial Results From the Super‐Parameterized E3SM

**Authors:** W. M. Hannah, C. R. Jones, B. R. Hillman, M. R. Norman, D. C. Bader et al. (12 authors)
**Journal:** Journal of Advances in Modeling Earth Systems (None)
**DOI:** [10.1029/2019ms001863](https://doi.org/10.1029/2019ms001863)

**Matched Topics:** earth system model
**Matched Fields:** environmental science

**Abstract:**

Results from the new Department of Energy super‐parameterized (SP) Energy Exascale Earth System Model (SP‐E3SM) are analyzed and compared to the traditionally parameterized E3SMv1 and previous studies using SP models. SP‐E3SM is unique in that it utilizes Graphics Processing Unit hardware acceleration, cloud resolving model mean‐state acceleration, and reduced radiation to dramatically increase the model throughput and allow decadal experiments at 100‐km external resolution. It also differs from other SP models by using a spectral element dynamical core on a cubed‐sphere grid and a finer vertical grid with a higher model top. Despite these differences, SP‐E3SM generally reproduces the behavior of other SP models. Tropical wave variability is improved relative to E3SM, including the emergen...

### Novel Representation of Leaf Phenology Improves Simulation of Amazonian Evergreen Forest Photosynthesis in a Land Surface Model

**Authors:** Xiuzhi Chen, Fabienne Maignan, Nicolas Viovy, Ana Bastos, Daniel Goll et al. (13 authors)
**Journal:** Journal of Advances in Modeling Earth Systems (None)
**DOI:** [10.1029/2018ms001565](https://doi.org/10.1029/2018ms001565)

**Matched Topics:** seasonal, land surface model
**Matched Fields:** environmental science

**Abstract:**

Leaf phenology in the humid tropics largely regulates the seasonality of forest carbon and water exchange. However, it is inadequately represented in most global land surface models due to limited understanding of its controls. Based on intensive field studies at four Amazonian evergreen forests, we propose a novel, quantitative representation of tropical forest leaf phenology, which links multiple environmental variables with the seasonality of new leaf production and old leaf litterfall. The new phenology simulates higher rates of leaf turnover (new leaves replacing old leaves) in dry seasons with more sunlight, which is then implemented in ORCHIDEE, together with recent findings of ontogeny‐associated photosynthetic capacity, and is evaluated against ground‐based measurements of leaf ph...

### Mathematical Reconstruction of Land Carbon Models From Their Numerical Output: Computing Soil Radiocarbon From C Dynamics

**Authors:** Holger Metzler, Qing Zhu, William Riley, Alison Hoyt, Markus Müller et al. (6 authors)
**Journal:** Journal of Advances in Modeling Earth Systems (None)
**DOI:** [10.1029/2019ms001776](https://doi.org/10.1029/2019ms001776)

**Matched Topics:** reservoir, earth system model
**Matched Fields:** environmental science

**Abstract:**

Radiocarbon (14C) is a powerful tracer of the global carbon cycle that is commonly used to assess carbon cycling rates in various Earth system reservoirs and as a benchmark to assess model performance. Therefore, it has been recommended that Earth System Models (ESMs) participating in the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 6 report predicted radiocarbon values for relevant carbon pools. However, a detailed representation of radiocarbon dynamics may be an impractical burden on model developers. Here, we present an alternative approach to compute radiocarbon values from the numerical output of an ESM that does not explicitly represent these dynamics. The approach requires computed 12C stocks and fluxes among all carbon pools for a particular simulation of the model. From this output...

### Collaborative Modeling With Fine‐Resolution Data Enhances Flood Awareness, Minimizes Differences in Flood Perception, and Produces Actionable Flood Maps

**Authors:** Brett F. Sanders, Jochen E. Schubert, Kristen A. Goodrich, Douglas Houston, David L. Feldman et al. (18 authors)
**Journal:** Earth's Future (None)
**DOI:** [10.1029/2019ef001391](https://doi.org/10.1029/2019ef001391)

**Matched Topics:** flood
**Matched Fields:** geography

**Abstract:**

Existing needs to manage flood risk in the United States are underserved by available flood hazard information. This contributes to an alarming escalation of flood impacts amounting to hundreds of billions of dollars per year and countless disrupted lives and affected communities. Making information about flood hazards useful for the range of decisions that dictate the consequences of flooding poses many challenges. Here, we describe collaborative flood modeling, whereby researchers and end‐users at two coastal sites co‐develop fine‐resolution flood hazard models and maps responsive to decision‐making needs. We find, first of all, that resident perception and awareness of flooding are enhanced more by fine‐resolution depth contour maps than Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) flood ...
