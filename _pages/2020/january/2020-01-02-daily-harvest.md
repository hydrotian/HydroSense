# Paper Harvest Report

**Date Range:** 2020-01-02 to 2020-01-02

**0** top-tier and **1** high-impact papers were selected out of **68** total publications (14.7%).

## Today's Highlights

Today's harvested paper introduces the GenTree Dendroecological Collection, a valuable new dataset of tree-ring and wood density data from seven European tree species. The primary research theme revolves around understanding tree adaptation to local environments, with a notable finding being the collection of individual tree-core characteristics. This dataset represents an emerging trend towards comprehensive, multi-species ecological data to support forest genetic resource management and climate change adaptation research.

**Abstract:**

The dataset presented here was collected by the GenTree project (EU-Horizon 2020), which aims to improve the use of forest genetic resources across Europe by better understanding how trees adapt to their local environment. This dataset of individual tree-core characteristics including ring-width series and whole-core wood density was collected for seven ecologically and economically important European tree species: silver birch (Betula pendula), European beech (Fagus sylvatica), Norway spruce (Picea abies), European black poplar (Populus nigra), maritime pine (Pinus pinaster), Scots pine (Pinus sylvestris), and sessile oak (Quercus petraea). Tree-ring width measurements were obtained from 3600 trees in 142 populations and whole-core wood density was measured for 3098 trees in 125 populatio...
