### Canadian forests are more conducive to high-severity fires in recent decades

**Authors:** Weiwei Wang, Xianli Wang, Mike D. Flannigan, Luc Guindon, Tom Swystun et al. (8 authors)
**Journal:** Science ⭐ (2025-01-03)
**DOI:** [10.1126/science.ado1006](https://doi.org/10.1126/science.ado1006)

**Matched Topics:** river

**Abstract:**

Canada has experienced more-intense and longer fire seasons with more-frequent uncontrollable wildfires over the past decades. However, the effect of these changes remains unknown. This study identifies driving forces of burn severity and estimates its spatiotemporal variations in Canadian forests. Our results show that fuel aridity was the most influential driver of burn severity, summer months were more prone to severe burning, and the northern areas were most influenced by the changing climate. About 6% (0.54 to 14.64%) of the modeled areas show significant increases in the number of days conducive to high-severity burning during 1981 to 2020, most of which were found during 2001 to 2020 and in the spring and autumn. The extraordinary 2023 fire season demonstrated similar spatial patter...

**Authors:** Yufan Chen, Shuyu Zhang, Hong Wang, Deliang Chen, Junguo Liu
**Journal:** Geophysical Research Letters ⭐ (2025-01-03)
**DOI:** [10.1029/2024gl111818](https://doi.org/10.1029/2024gl111818)

**Matched Topics:** river, flood, climate change

**Abstract:**

Understanding the drivers behind extreme precipitation is crucial for predicting and mitigating the impacts of climate change globally, yet it remains little known how anthropogenic factors contribute to these phenomena. This study investigates the impact of human‐induced climate change on circulation patterns conducive to extreme precipitation over the Central Plains Urban Agglomeration in China, a region frequently experiencing severe flooding and home to a dense population with significant economic and agricultural activities. Using advanced techniques such as deep learning and optimal fingerprinting, this study identifies and analyzes the physical mechanisms behind the extreme precipitation. The findings reveal that greenhouse gas emissions play a pivotal role in altering atmospheric c...

### The Influence of Topography on the Global Terrestrial Water Cycle

**Authors:** Sebastian Gnann, Jane W. Baldwin, Mark O. Cuthbert, Tom Gleeson, Wolfgang Schwanghart et al. (6 authors)
**Journal:** Reviews of Geophysics ⭐ (2025-01-03)
**DOI:** [10.1029/2023rg000810](https://doi.org/10.1029/2023rg000810)

**Matched Topics:** climate change

**Abstract:**

Topography affects the distribution and movement of water on Earth, yet new insights about topographic controls continue to surprise us and exciting puzzles remain. Here we combine literature review and data synthesis to explore the influence of topography on the global terrestrial water cycle, from the atmosphere down to the groundwater. Above the land surface, topography induces gradients and contrasts in water and energy availability. Long‐term precipitation usually increases with elevation in the mid‐latitudes, while it peaks at low‐ to mid‐elevations in the tropics. Potential evaporation tends to decrease with elevation in all climate zones. At the land surface, topography is expressed in snow distribution, vegetation zonation, geomorphic landforms, the critical zone, and drainage net...

### Skillful seasonal predictions of continental East-Asian summer rainfall by integrating its spatio-temporal evolution

**Authors:** Jieru Ma, Hong-Li Ren, Ming Cai, Yi Deng, Chenguang Zhou et al. (8 authors)
**Journal:** Nature Communications ⭐ (2025-01-03)
**DOI:** [10.1038/s41467-024-55271-1](https://doi.org/10.1038/s41467-024-55271-1)

**Matched Topics:** flood, drought, seasonal, climate change

**Abstract:**

Skillful seasonal climate prediction is critical for food and water security over the world's heavily populated regions, such as in continental East Asia. Current models, however, face significant difficulties in predicting the summer mean rainfall anomaly over continental East Asia, and forecasting rainfall spatiotemporal evolution presents an even greater challenge. Here, we benefit from integrating the spatiotemporal evolution of rainfall to identify the most crucial patterns intrinsic to continental East-Asian rainfall anomalies. A physical-statistical prediction model is developed to capture the predictability offered by these patterns through a detection of precursor signals that describe slowly varying lower boundary conditions. The presented model demonstrates a prediction skill of...

### Leveraging a time-series event separation method to disentangle time-varying hydrologic controls on streamflow – application to wildfire-affected catchments

**Authors:** Haley A. Canham, Belize Lane, Colin B. Phillips, Brendan P. Murphy
**Journal:** Hydrology and Earth System Sciences (2025-01-03)
**DOI:** [10.5194/hess-29-27-2025](https://doi.org/10.5194/hess-29-27-2025)

**Matched Topics:** runoff, streamflow, seasonal

**Abstract:**

Increasing watershed disturbance regimes, such as from wildfire, are a growing concern for natural resource managers. However, the influence of watershed disturbances on event-scale rainfall–runoff patterns has proved challenging to disentangle from other hydrologic controls. To better isolate watershed disturbance effects, this study evaluates the influence of several time-varying hydrologic controls on event-scale rainfall–runoff patterns, including water year type, seasonality, and antecedent precipitation. To accomplish this, we developed the Rainfall–Runoff Event Detection and Identification (RREDI) toolkit, an automated time-series event separation and attribution algorithm that overcomes several limitations of existing techniques. The RREDI toolkit was used to generate a d...

### The Interpretation of Karakoram Anomaly by High Karakoram Ice Core Record

**Authors:** Jiajia Wang, Baiqing Xu, Zhen Li, Jawad Nasir, Suhaib Bin Farhan et al. (10 authors)
**Journal:** Journal of Geophysical Research: Atmospheres (2025-01-03)
**DOI:** [10.1029/2023jd040235](https://doi.org/10.1029/2023jd040235)

**Matched Topics:** climate change

**Abstract:**

Glacier mass in the Karakoram region has increased since the mid‐1990s in contrast to Himalayan glaciers. The scarcity and brevity of observations, including in situ observations and weather station data, limit our understanding of the Karakoram anomaly. Here, we present the stable water isotopes and snow accumulation records of Karakoram's first shallow ice core, covering 1998 to 2018. The decreased δ18O suggests an overall cooling trend in the Karakoram region for the early 21st century. In contrast, snow accumulation shows a significant increasing trend, which reveals that the Karakoram glacier has been getting more and more precipitation supplies recently. Using correlation field analysis and a backward trajectory model, we find that the decreased temperature and increased precipitatio...

### Risk-based bridge life cycle cost and environmental impact assessment considering climate change effects

**Authors:** Sang Hyeon Lee, Lee-Sak An, Ho-Kyung Kim
**Journal:** Scientific Reports (2025-01-03)
**DOI:** [10.1038/s41598-024-82568-4](https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-024-82568-4)

**Matched Topics:** climate change

**Abstract:**

To enhance sustainability and resilience against climate change in infrastructure, a quantitative evaluation of both environmental impact and cost is important within a life cycle framework. Climate change effects can lead performance deterioration in bridge components during their operational phase, highlighting the necessity for a risk-based evaluation process aligned with maintenance strategies. This study employs a two-phase life cycle assessments (LCA) framework. First, risk assessments are conducted to evaluate the impact of climate change on steel plate girder bridges and prestressed concrete (PSC) girder bridges under identical structural conditions. The reduction in flexural strength of steel plate girders and PSC girders due to changes in environmental variables such as temperatu...

### Evaluating multiannual sedimentary nutrient retention in agricultural two-stage channels

**Authors:** Kaisa Västilä, Tom Jilbert
**Journal:** Scientific Reports (2025-01-03)
**DOI:** [10.1038/s41598-024-84956-2](https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-024-84956-2)

**Matched Topics:** flood

**Abstract:**

The two-stage channel (TSC) design with a vegetated man-made floodplain has been recommended as an alternative to conventional re-dredging for managing suspended sediment (SS) and nutrient loads in agricultural streams. However, there are currently uncertainties surrounding the efficiency of TSCs, since mass balances covering the whole annual hydrograph and including different periods of the channel life cycle are lacking. This paper aims to improve understanding of the medium-term morphological development and sedimentary nutrient retention when a dredged, trapezoidal-shaped channel is converted into a TSC, using a mass balance estimate of nutrient and carbon retention from immediately after excavation until the establishment of approximate biogeochemical equilibrium retention. We develop...

### Downscaling of ERA5 reanalysis land surface temperature based on attention mechanism and Google Earth Engine

**Authors:** Shiyu Li, Hong Wan, Qun Yu, Xinyuan Wang
**Journal:** Scientific Reports (2025-01-03)
**DOI:** [10.1038/s41598-024-83944-w](https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-024-83944-w)

**Matched Topics:** climate change

**Abstract:**

Land Surface Temperature (LST) is widely recognized as a sensitive indicator of climate change, and it plays a significant role in ecological research. The ERA5-Land LST dataset, developed and managed by the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF), is extensively used for global or regional LST studies. However, its fine-scale application is limited by its low spatial resolution. Therefore, to improve the spatial resolution of ERA5-Land LST data, this study proposes an Attention Mechanism U-Net (AMUN) method, which combines data acquisition and preprocessing on the Google Earth Engine (GEE) cloud computing platform, to downscale the hourly monthly mean reanalysis LST data of ERA5-Land across China's territory from 0.1° to 0.01°. This method comprehensively considers the ...

### Topographic location and connectivity to channel of earthquake- and rainfall-induced landslides in Loess Plateau area

**Authors:** Siyuan Ma, Xiaoyi Shao, Chong Xu, Xiaoli Chen, Renmao Yuan
**Journal:** Scientific Reports (2025-01-03)
**DOI:** [10.1038/s41598-024-84885-0](https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-024-84885-0)

**Matched Topics:** river

**Abstract:**

The position of landslides on a slope plays a crucial role in determining landslide susceptibility and the likelihood of landslide debris interacting with the fluvial system. Most studies primarily focus on shallow landslides in the bedrock weathering zone or large-scale bedrock landslides, but the relevant work about the location and connectivity to channels of loess landslides is limited despite their potential to provide insights into slope stability and material transport in loess regions. In this study, we explored differences in landslide location and connectivity to channels between 2013 Mw5.9 Minxian earthquake-induced (EQ) landslides and 2013 Tianshui rainfall-induced (RF) landslides in the Loess Plateau area, China. The result shows that more than 37% of EQ landslides occur in th...
