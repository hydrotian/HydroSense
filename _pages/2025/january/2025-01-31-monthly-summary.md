# January 2025 Monthly Summary

## Overview

**Reporting Period:** January 1-31, 2025
**Daily Reports:** 6 reports generated
**Total Papers Reviewed:** 1,247
**Papers Selected:** 68 (5.5%)

## Key Trends

### Climate Change & Hydrologic Extremes
January saw a surge in publications addressing climate-driven changes in hydrologic extremes:
