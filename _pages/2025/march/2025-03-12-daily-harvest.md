# Part 1: Top-Tier Journals + Topic Match (3 papers)

### Climate-driven changes in global river discharge patterns

**Authors:** John Smith, Jane Doe, Alice Johnson
**Journal:** Science ⭐ (2025-03-12)
**DOI:** [10.1126/science.example001](https://doi.org/10.1126/science.example001)

**Matched Topics:** river, runoff, climate change

**Abstract:**

Global river discharge patterns are experiencing significant changes due to climate variability and anthropogenic influences. This study analyzes discharge data from 5000+ rivers worldwide spanning 1950-2024. We identify accelerated changes in runoff timing, with spring peak flows occurring 1-2 weeks earlier in snow-dominated basins. Summer low flows show decreasing trends in 60% of analyzed rivers, with implications for water supply and ecosystem health.

### Machine learning for seasonal streamflow forecasting

**Authors:** Bob Zhang, Carol White
**Journal:** Nature Communications ⭐ (2025-03-12)
**DOI:** [10.1038/s41467-025-example](https://doi.org/10.1038/s41467-025-example)

**Matched Topics:** seasonal, streamflow, hydrologic model

**Abstract:**

Seasonal streamflow forecasting is critical for water resource management. We develop a hybrid ML framework combining LSTM networks with process-based models. Testing across 200 basins shows 35% improvement in forecast skill at 3-month lead times compared to traditional methods.

### Reservoir operations under extreme drought conditions

**Authors:** David Lee, Emily Chen, Frank Martinez
**Journal:** Geophysical Research Letters ⭐ (2025-03-12)
**DOI:** [10.1029/2025GL012345](https://doi.org/10.1029/2025GL012345)

**Matched Topics:** reservoir, drought, water management

**Abstract:**

Reservoir systems face unprecedented challenges under multi-year drought conditions. This study examines operational strategies across 50 major reservoirs during the 2020-2023 western US drought. Adaptive management approaches reduced water supply curtailments by 25% while maintaining ecological flow requirements.

# Part 2: High-Impact Journals + Topic Match (6 papers)

### Urban flood risk assessment using deep learning

**Authors:** Grace Park, Henry Liu
**Journal:** Water Resources Research (2025-03-12)
**DOI:** [10.1029/2024WR067890](https://doi.org/10.1029/2024WR067890)

**Matched Topics:** flood, urban hydrology

**Abstract:**

Urban flooding poses increasing risks due to infrastructure aging and climate change. We develop a CNN-based model for real-time flood inundation prediction using street-level imagery and rainfall data. Validation in three cities demonstrates 85% accuracy in predicting flood extent 2 hours in advance.

### Hydropower generation under climate variability

**Authors:** Isabel Martinez, Jake Anderson
**Journal:** Scientific Reports (2025-03-12)
**DOI:** [10.1038/s41598-025-12345-x](https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-025-12345-x)

**Matched Topics:** hydropower, climate change

**Abstract:**

Climate variability impacts hydropower generation through altered streamflow patterns. Analysis of 100 hydropower facilities shows 15% decline in generation capacity during drought years, with recovery periods exceeding 3 years. Adaptive scheduling strategies can mitigate 40% of these losses.
