### Evaluating E-OBS forcing data for large-sample hydrology using model performance diagnostics

**Authors:** Franziska Clerc-Schwarzenbach, Thiago V. M. do Nascimento
**Journal:** Hydrology and Earth System Sciences (2026-01-13)
**DOI:** [10.5194/hess-30-119-2026](https://doi.org/10.5194/hess-30-119-2026)

**Matched Topics:** hydrology

**Abstract:**

Abstract. For large-sample hydrological studies over large spatial domains, large-scale meteorological forcing data are often desired. For Europe, the EStreams dataset and catalogue satisfies this demand. In EStreams, the meteorological time series are obtained from the Ensemble Observation (E-OBS) product which is available for all of Europe. Due to the large spatial extent of this dataset, limitations and regional variations of data quality have to be expected when the dataset is compared to smaller-scale datasets, e.g., at national level. In this study, we compare the meteorological time series included for 2682 catchments in EStreams to eight smaller datasets (mostly CAMELS datasets). We assess how the different meteorological data impact the performance of a bucket-type hydrological m...

### Evaluation of high-resolution meteorological data products using flux tower observations across Brazil

**Authors:** Jamie R. C. Brown, Ross Woods, Humberto Ribeiro da Rocha, Debora Regina Roberti, Rafael Rosolem
**Journal:** Hydrology and Earth System Sciences (2026-01-13)
**DOI:** [10.5194/hess-30-141-2026](https://doi.org/10.5194/hess-30-141-2026)

**Matched Topics:** land surface model

**Abstract:**

Abstract. In the past decade, the scientific community has seen an increase in the number of global hydrometeorological products. This has been possible with efforts to push continental and global land surface modelling to hyper-resolution applications. As the resolution of these datasets increases, so does the need to compare their estimates against local in-situ measurements. This is particularly important for Brazil, whose large continental-scale domain results in a wide range of climates and biomes. In this study, high-resolution (0.1 to 0.25°) global and regional meteorological datasets are compared against flux tower observations at 11 sites across Brazil (for periods between 1999–2010), covering Brazil's main land cover types (tropical rainforest, woodland savanna, various croplands...

### The Memories of Soil Moisture and Soil Temperature Anomalies in Subsequent Soil Moisture and Soil Temperature in China

**Authors:** Yaoming Song, Haishan Chen, Lin Wang, Anning Huang, Wei Gu
**Journal:** Journal of Geophysical Research: Atmospheres (2026-01-13)
**DOI:** [10.1029/2025jd044117](https://doi.org/10.1029/2025jd044117)

**Matched Topics:** flood, land surface model

**Abstract:**

The memories of soil moisture (SM) and soil temperature (ST) modulate the effect of land surface on climate prediction on monthly and longer timescales. Based on a Lagrangian‐based understanding of SM and ST memories, this study explores the characteristics of SM and ST memories using ERA5‐Land reanalysis data, observations, land surface model and WRF model. The results show that SM and ST memories are longer in North China, Northeast China, Northwest China and Qinghai‐Tibet Plateau than in other regions of China, even exceeding 10 months. In the southern part of China, memories are short, approximately 0–6 months. SM memories have similar spatial distributions at different soil depths over 12 months, as do ST memories. The WRF‐simulated memories show generally consistent spatial patterns ...

### Impacts of climate change and land use dynamics on soil erosion in the Qinghai–Tibet plateau

**Authors:** Eslam Rashad, Yujie Liu, Zhaoyang Shi, Ahmed Refaee, Tao Pan
**Journal:** Scientific Reports (2026-01-13)
**DOI:** [10.1038/s41598-025-34550-x](https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-025-34550-x)

**Matched Topics:** river, water management, climate change

**Abstract:**

Soil erosion (SE) caused by water is exacerbated by climate change and human activity, threatening water resources and ecological stability. The Qinghai-Tibet Plateau (QTP), with its unique ecosystem and river systems, is heavily influenced by sedimentation linked to water- induced SE. This study evaluates current SE patterns on the QTP and forecasts soil loss for 2050 and 2090 to identify priority areas for soil and water conservation. SE trends from 1985 to 2020 were conducted using the InVEST model. The CA-Markov model, in conjunction with CMIP6 climate projections, was employed to predict SE under varying land use and cover (LUCC) and climate change scenarios for the future. The results show that the average annual SE on the QTP stands at 20.02 t h⁻¹ ya⁻¹ from 1985 to 2020. Under the L...

### Optimized spectral indices for global vegetation and water mapping using Sentinel-2

**Authors:** Charalambos Chrysostomou, Stelios P. Neophytides, Michalis Mavrovouniotis, Diofantos G. Hadjimitsis
**Journal:** Scientific Reports (2026-01-13)
**DOI:** [10.1038/s41598-025-34720-x](https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-025-34720-x)

**Matched Topics:** surface water

**Abstract:**

Reliable mapping of vegetation and surface water from satellite imagery remains challenging, as common spectral indices can saturate at high biomass, show limited sensitivity across ecosystems, and confuse targets with soil, shadows, or built-up surfaces. We present two indices, the Symbolic Regression Vegetation Index (SRVI) and the Symbolic Regression Water Index (SRWI), discovered with a data-driven symbolic regression framework applied to Sentinel-2 Level-2A reflectance and guided by ESA WorldCover labels. Expressions were evolved from physically interpretable building blocks using non-linear combinations of visible, NIR, and SWIR bands. Indices were derived on a spectrally complex Mediterranean site and evaluated on eleven independent regions spanning diverse biomes. Performance was a...

### Hybrid PSO-SVM and symbolic regression model for agricultural water demand prediction

**Authors:** Hong Lv, Yuting Zhao, Wei Wang, Kai Hou, Xiaokang Zheng
**Journal:** Scientific Reports (2026-01-13)
**DOI:** [10.1038/s41598-026-34995-8](https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-026-34995-8)

**Matched Topics:** irrigation

**Abstract:**

Agricultural water use is a key link in ensuring food security and the sustainable utilization of water resources. Understanding its evolutionary mechanisms holds significant theoretical and practical importance. This study focuses on Bayannur City, employing the Particle Swarm Optimization–Support Vector Machine (PSO-SVM) model to identify the primary controlling factors of agricultural water demand and using symbolic regression to construct a predictive equation. The results reveal a bidirectional guiding mechanism in agricultural water use: it is driven by factors such as Effective Irrigated Area and Grain Sown Area, and inhibited by High-Efficiency Irrigation Rate, Water Stress Index, and Agricultural Water Price, which demonstrates a linear restraining effect. The prediction model ind...
