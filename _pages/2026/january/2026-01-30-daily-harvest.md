### Variable Flood Discharge Constrains Autochthonous Organic Carbon Preservation in Deltas: Insights From Physical Experiments

**Authors:** Jose R. Silvestre, Zachary Hom, Kelly M. Sanks, Samuel M. Zapp, John B. Shaw et al. (6 authors)
**Journal:** Geophysical Research Letters ⭐ (2026-01-30)
**DOI:** [10.1029/2025gl119769](https://doi.org/10.1029/2025gl119769)

**Matched Topics:** flood

**Abstract:**


 Many global and regional climate models predict shifts in the frequency and magnitude of precipitation events. It is unclear how this transition will influence delta and wetland development. We address this knowledge gap via two reduced‐scale physical delta experiments: one with constant discharge and the other with variable discharge. Floods with a peak discharge equal to three times the baseflow reduce the mean total delta‐top area by a factor of two and a half and increase slopes by a factor of two. Enhanced channel mobility increases delta top slopes and limits large‐scale shoreline movement, which reduce wetland planform. There is a 108% difference in the volume of preserved organic material in the subsurface between the variable and constant discharge conditions. Morphometric diffe...

### The Atmosphere's Substantial Role in Interannual Variability of Earth's Energy Imbalance

**Authors:** Michael Mayer, Norman G. Loeb, John M. Lyman, Gregory C. Johnson, Susanna Winkelbauer
**Journal:** Geophysical Research Letters ⭐ (2026-01-30)
**DOI:** [10.1029/2025gl119833](https://doi.org/10.1029/2025gl119833)

**Matched Topics:** climate change

**Abstract:**


 Earth's Energy Imbalance (EEI) is a key metric to quantify climate change. While the ocean absorbs most excess heat, the atmosphere contributes only 1%–2% to the long‐term mean of EEI. However, our analysis of observational data demonstrates that variations in the atmosphere's energy content play a much larger role in interannual variations of EEI, especially in recent years. Including atmospheric energy uptake substantially improves agreement between observed variations in global net radiative flux at top‐of‐atmosphere (TOA) and ocean heat uptake interannually over 2005–2024. It also reconciles a delay between variability of these two quantities, with oceanic storage variability leading net TOA flux anomalies by ∼2 months. The phase shift can be explained by the atmosphere's important r...

### FloodUnet: A Rapid Spatio‐Temporal Prediction Model for Flood Evolution Based on an Enhanced U‐Net

**Authors:** T. Chen, J. Tian, J. Sun, Z. Zhang, H. Chai et al. (7 authors)
**Journal:** Water Resources Research (2026-01-30)
**DOI:** [10.1029/2025wr041427](https://doi.org/10.1029/2025wr041427)

**Matched Topics:** flood

**Abstract:**


 Flooding causes significant loss of life and economic damage and affects healthy development of society. Deep learning (DL) models demonstrate significant advantages in improving computational efficiency while maintaining accuracy. Existing research of predicting dynamic flood evolution still remains some gaps for predicting flooding maps from the initial time step, weak transferability for flood scenarios from unseen breaches, and potential enhancement of common neural network frameworks. This paper proposes a DL model called FloodUnet based on an improved U‐Net architecture to achieve rapid and accurate prediction of flood evolution. FloodUnet can predict a series of flooding depth maps and maintain high‐precision prediction. It achieves an average root mean square error of 0.2 m and a...

### Analytical Model of Velocity Distribution and Penetration Characteristics in Water‐Level Fluctuation Zone With Vegetation

**Authors:** An‐Qi Li, Xiao‐Bo Liu, Wei‐Jie Wang, Zhuo‐Wei Wang, Feng‐Jiao Li et al. (7 authors)
**Journal:** Water Resources Research (2026-01-30)
**DOI:** [10.1029/2025wr041130](https://doi.org/10.1029/2025wr041130)

**Matched Topics:** flood

**Abstract:**


 As a critical ecological transition zone between aquatic and terrestrial ecosystems, the water‐level fluctuation zone significantly influences flow structure through vegetation morphology. Conventional analytical velocity models inadequately address the variation in vegetation with water depth. In this study, we developed a hydrodynamic coupled model with vertically varying leaf vegetation widths and derived its analytical solutions. We have updated the dynamic invasion width formula in the context of studying vegetation‐flow interactions within water‐level fluctuation zones. This work quantitatively investigates flow interactions at the main channel‐floodplain interface, establishes a dynamic relationship between the resistance coefficient and vegetation geometric parameters, and propos...

### Identification of Key Factors Driving Dissolved Oxygen in Riparian Aquifers Through Deep Learning‐Assisted Global Sensitivity Analysis

**Authors:** Heng Dai, Yijie Yang, Fangqiang Zhang, Alberto Guadagnini, Jing Yang et al. (9 authors)
**Journal:** Water Resources Research (2026-01-30)
**DOI:** [10.1029/2025wr041884](https://doi.org/10.1029/2025wr041884)

**Matched Topics:** river

**Abstract:**


 We rely on a global sensitivity analysis (GSA) approach to identify the dominant physical and biogeochemical controls on dissolved oxygen (DO) dynamics in riparian aquifers. The study is motivated by the observation that availability of DO is key to regulating redox conditions and associated processes in the subsurface. Yet, the complexity of coupled flow and transport models, combined with model input uncertainty challenges our ability to fully characterize system behavior. To address this issue, we integrate Bayesian network‐based and variance‐based methods into a comprehensive GSA framework, enabling a robust evaluation of parameter and process sensitivities. To overcome the high computational demand of GSA for complex numerical models, we develop surrogate models using deep learning ...

### Hydrology in the Age of Artificial Intelligence: From Fragmentation to Coherent Terrestrial Hydrosphere Science

**Authors:** Scott L. Painter, Georgia Destouni
**Journal:** Water Resources Research (2026-01-30)
**DOI:** [10.1029/2026wr043509](https://doi.org/10.1029/2026wr043509)

**Matched Topics:** hydrology, streamflow

**Abstract:**


 The rapid rise of machine learning (ML) in hydrology has prompted debate about the discipline's scientific relevance. While ML often outperforms traditional models in streamflow prediction, we argue that this reflects a deeper limitation: persistent fragmentation of hydrological science itself. Narrow focus on isolated components has hindered the development of coherent, scale‐relevant understanding of the integrated terrestrial hydrosphere. This is illustrated, for example, by widely divergent estimates of groundwater–streamflow interactions and of water balance‐implied ongoing storage changes. We argue that hydrology's future lies not in choosing between ML and physics, but in integrating data‐driven and process‐based approaches to advance consistent, realistic, and societally relevant...

### Detecting the occurrence of preferential flow in soils with stable water isotopes

**Authors:** Jonas Pyschik, Markus Weiler
**Journal:** Hydrology and Earth System Sciences (2026-01-30)
**DOI:** [10.5194/hess-30-485-2026](https://doi.org/10.5194/hess-30-485-2026)

**Matched Topics:** runoff, seasonal

**Abstract:**

Abstract. Subsurface flow in preferential pathways in soils may transport water more rapidly than the soil matrix, may be quickly activated during precipitation events and enhance infiltration or interflow. Vertical pathways are particularly important for runoff generation. However, identifying these pathways is challenging because traditional methods such as piezometers, soil moisture sensors, or hillslope trenches do not adequately capture the spatial scale and frequency of preferential flow features, while other experimental techniques like dye tracing are labor-intensive and invasive. In this study, we introduce a novel method to identify the locations of preferential flow by analysing vertical soil profiles of stable water isotopes. Across four catchments, we drilled 100 soil cores (1...

### Setting up the physical principles of resilience in a model of the Earth System

**Authors:** Orfeu Bertolami, Magnus Nyström
**Journal:** Earth System Dynamics (2026-01-30)
**DOI:** [10.5194/esd-17-141-2026](https://doi.org/10.5194/esd-17-141-2026)

**Matched Topics:** climate change

**Abstract:**

Abstract. Resilience is a property of social, ecological, social-ecological and biophysical systems. It describes the capacity of a system to cope with, adapt to and innovate in response to a changing surrounding. Given the current climate change crisis, ensuring conditions for a sustainable future for the habitability on the planet is fundamentally dependent on Earth System (ES) resilience. It is thus particularly relevant to establish a model that captures and frames resilience of the ES, most particularly in physical terms that can be influenced by human policy1. In this work we propose that resilience can serve as a theoretical foundation when unpacking and describing metastable states of equilibrium and energy dissipation in any dynamic description of the variables that characterise t...

### Vegetation type, landscape and climate define vegetation water content: implications for sustainable management at Southern Patagonia

**Authors:** Long Jia, Julián Rodríguez Souilla, María Vanessa Lencinas, Pablo Luis Peri, Xinwu Li et al. (7 authors)
**Journal:** Environmental Research Letters (2026-01-30)
**DOI:** [10.1088/1748-9326/ae3b56](https://doi.org/10.1088/1748-9326/ae3b56)

**Matched Topics:** seasonal

**Abstract:**

Ecosystem management requires integrative tools for planning and decision-making at landscape scales. Vegetation water content (VWC) has been proposed as a holistic indicator of entire plant water status and ecosystem functioning. However, few studies have explored its relationships with ecological and environmental factors, especially in data-scarce regions like Patagonia. In this study, we used the SMAP dataset to analyzed VWC patterns across vegetation types, landscapes, and climate anomalies over the 2015–2016 to 2024–2025 growing seasons in Southern Patagonia, covering Santa Cruz and Tierra del Fuego provinces. The results show that VWC varies significantly among vegetation types. Forests and shrublands generally had higher VWC than grasslands. Among them, Nothofagus betuloides and ev...

### Long run emulator calibration increases warming and sea-level rise projections

**Authors:** Christopher D Wells, Donald P Cummins, Haozhe He, Chris Smith
**Journal:** Environmental Research Letters (2026-01-30)
**DOI:** [10.1088/1748-9326/ae3847](https://doi.org/10.1088/1748-9326/ae3847)

**Matched Topics:** climate change, earth system model

**Abstract:**

Owing to their short runtime compared to Earth system models (ESMs), as well as the difficulty for the latest ESMs from the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 6 (CMIP6) to reproduce historical warming and the so-called ‘hot model problem’, constrained reduced-complexity climate models (‘emulators’) are increasingly used to produce global warming projections from emissions scenarios. Emulators are often calibrated on idealised abrupt CO2 quadrupling experiments from CMIP6, particularly the global surface temperature response over time to an imposed radiative forcing. Such CMIP6 experiments tend to be run for 150 years, which is not sufficient to reveal the full equilibrium response to an imposed climate forcing. Here we show that, when longer experiments are available for emulator ...

### Numerical representation of turbulent fluxes during the March 2019 Nebraska rain-on-snow event

**Authors:** Ross D Dixon, Erik J Janzon, Tirthankar Roy, Zachary J Suriano, Samuel Davidson
**Journal:** Environmental Research Letters (2026-01-30)
**DOI:** [10.1088/1748-9326/ae3fb0](https://doi.org/10.1088/1748-9326/ae3fb0)

**Matched Topics:** runoff, flood, land surface model

**Abstract:**


 Rain-on-snow (ROS) events—during which liquid precipitation falls on an existing surface snowpack—are highly impactful to society, with severe flooding being the primary hazard. ROS events remain a highly challenging hydrometeorological problem in several aspects of land surface model development, pushing the limits of land-atmosphere, snowpack, and runoff modeling. In particular, the representation of turbulent fluxes during these events is critical as energy into the snowpack controls the rate of melt and may impact the magnitude of resulting flooding. In this study, we investigate the representation of these turbulent fluxes in the Weather Research & Forecasting (WRF) model coupled to the Noah-MP land model during a ROS event. For this case study, we use an extreme ROS event which occ...

### Projected changes in sea level seasonal cycle alter global coastal flood hazards

**Authors:** Ying Qu, Svetlana Jevrejeva, Jiayi Fang, Shijin Wang
**Journal:** Environmental Research Letters (2026-01-30)
**DOI:** [10.1088/1748-9326/ae3b57](https://doi.org/10.1088/1748-9326/ae3b57)

**Matched Topics:** flood, seasonal

**Abstract:**

In coastal areas, projected increases in the amplitude of the sea level seasonal cycle will lead to the intensification of coastal flood hazards. Conversely, projected decreases in the amplitude may act to suppress flood hazards in some regions, partially offsetting the impact of sea level rise. Simulations of the sea level seasonal cycle by the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 6 (CMIP6) models suggest changes up to ±30% are projected under a high emission scenario. We demonstrate that a currently unaccounted increase of 5–10 cm in the sea level seasonal cycle will increase the frequency of extremes from once in 20 years to once in 10 years. However, the sea level seasonal cycle amplitudes in CMIP6 models are underestimated compared to seasonal variability observed by satellite ...

### Climate double whammy: assessing the physical and transition climate risks of overseas power projects

**Authors:** Xia Li, Kevin P Gallagher, Xu Chen
**Journal:** Environmental Research Letters (2026-01-30)
**DOI:** [10.1088/1748-9326/ae3848](https://doi.org/10.1088/1748-9326/ae3848)

**Matched Topics:** flood, hydropower

**Abstract:**

This study examines both the physical and transition climate risks of 578 bilaterally-financed overseas power projects across 105 countries, funded by the world’s three largest economies–the United States, China, and Japan. We geolocate each power project and obtain forecasted physical climate risk exposures at these locations using data from Moody’s ESG Solutions. We measure transition climate risks using the project specific committed CO₂ emissions and find a positive correlation between physical and transition climate risks across these projects—which are driven primarily by fossil fuel investments. Coal power plants exhibit the highest level of both physical and transition climate risks. Although hydropower projects tend to have lower carbon emissions, they face the highest flood risk ...

### Arctic warming delays the Afro-Asian monsoon retreat amplifying autumn rainfall

**Authors:** Jie Zhang, Haishan Chen, Weiqiang Ma, Rafi Riaz, Sidra Syed et al. (7 authors)
**Journal:** Environmental Research Letters (2026-01-30)
**DOI:** [10.1088/1748-9326/ae3974](https://doi.org/10.1088/1748-9326/ae3974)

**Matched Topics:** flood, seasonal

**Abstract:**

The Afro-Asian summer monsoon (AfroA-SM) provides essential rainfall for billions of people. However, in recent decades, unusually wet conditions have persisted into autumn, creating unprecedented extremes. Using multidecadal observations, reanalysis datasets, and Polar Amplification Model Intercomparison Project (PAMIP) simulations, we show that Arctic warming significantly postpones the retreat of the AfroA-SM. This delay shifts the northernmost summer monsoon boundary by 5.6°–12° and accounts for 33%–69% of September precipitation across North Africa, South Asia, the Tibetan Plateau, and East Asia. The mechanism is anchored in a northward displacement of the subtropical jet stream, which is driven by reduced meridional temperature gradients resulting from sea‐ice loss and Arctic amplifi...

### Anthropogenic Forcings Intensify Droughts More Severely in Drylands than in Humid Regions

**Authors:** Yanting Zhang, Renguang Wu, Xiao‐Tong Zheng, Jiahui Mei, Lin Sun
**Journal:** Journal of Geophysical Research: Atmospheres (2026-01-30)
**DOI:** [10.1029/2025jd044821](https://doi.org/10.1029/2025jd044821)

**Matched Topics:** drought

**Abstract:**


 Droughts of different durations affect water resources and ecosystems in distinct ways. Human activities have been confirmed to contribute to the increased occurrence of droughts; however, the dependence of these impacts on the durations of drought, and whether they differ between drylands and humid regions, remains insufficiently understood. This study investigates the human influence on droughts of different durations using the Standardized Precipitation Evapotranspiration Index (SPEI), derived from multi‐source observations and four sets of Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 6 (CMIP6) multi‐model simulations. The results show that human activities cause an intensification of long‐term droughts, particularly in drylands. This is primarily attributed to rising greenhouse gas (G...

**DOI:** [10.1175/jhm-d-25-0061.1](https://doi.org/10.1175/jhm-d-25-0061.1)

**Matched Topics:** seasonal

**Abstract:**


 
 This study presents a statistical analysis of snow cover trends in the Northern Hemisphere using the
 Rutgers Northern Hemisphere 24 km Weekly Snow Cover Extent, September 1980 Onward, Version 1
 data which observe either snow presence or absence at each cell in binary format. A quality control procedure is applied prior to trend assessment to identify problematic cells, which are excluded from further analysis. Of the cells studied over the Northern Hemisphere that meet the quality control requirements, 9.4% indicate a statistically significant positive trend while 23.8% report a statistically significant negative trend, indicating a roughly 2.5:1 ratio of area with snow cover declines relative to snow cover increases. On a seasonal scale, there is a general positive trend in snow cov...

### An Earth System Model Ensemble Forced With Probabilistic Emissions: Demonstration and Prospects for Climate Risk Assessment

**Authors:** Jeremy Fyke, Neil C. Swart, David Huard
**Journal:** Earth's Future (2026-01-30)
**DOI:** [10.1029/2025ef007289](https://doi.org/10.1029/2025ef007289)

**Matched Topics:** river, climate change, earth system model

**Abstract:**


 Future projections of climate change are uncertain, in part because of uncertainty in future greenhouse gas emissions. However, current widely used emission scenarios and related physical climate projections have no probabilities associated with them, presenting a challenge for risk‐informed climate adaptation decision making. Motivated to close this gap, we demonstrate an ensemble of full‐complexity Earth System Model‐based climate projections that include explicit estimates of emissions uncertainty. This approach avoids the need to condition future Earth System Model projections on storyline‐based climate scenarios and provides information that can be probabilistically interpreted directly for arbitrary climate metrics including regional climate impact drivers. This addresses a key nee...

### Impacts of Climate Change and Human Activities on Global Mountain Grasslands: Insights Into the Last Two Decades and Future Climate Scenarios

**Authors:** Mulun Na, Giulia Zuecco, Paolo Tarolli
**Journal:** Earth's Future (2026-01-30)
**DOI:** [10.1029/2025ef006419](https://doi.org/10.1029/2025ef006419)

**Matched Topics:** climate change

**Abstract:**


 Mountain grasslands are vital ecosystems providing critical services such as carbon sequestration, water regulation, and biodiversity conservation. However, these ecosystems are increasingly threatened by climate change and human activities. This study evaluates vegetation dynamics in global mountain grasslands (2000–2021) using remote sensing data, CMIP6 climate projections, and human modification indices. By means of machine learning models (Random Forest, eXtreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost), and Long Short‐Term Memory (LSTM)) we identified dewpoint temperature, total evaporation, and human modification as dominant predictors of vegetation change, while soil water content and latent heat flux exhibited region‐specific impacts. Results indicate that 35.1% of grasslands remained stable, ...

### Tile-drainage and Crop Rotation Enhanced Cropland Dataset to Improve Spatial Accuracy of Eco-hydrologic Models

**Authors:** Revanth Mamidala, Lu Liu
**Journal:** Scientific Data (2026-01-30)
**DOI:** [10.1038/s41597-026-06693-7](https://doi.org/10.1038/s41597-026-06693-7)

**Matched Topics:** hydrologic model

**Abstract:**

Ecohydrological modeling has advanced through integration of geospatial datasets, where input data accuracy and spatial resolution critically influence model representativeness and estimates of water balance and streamflow. In the U.S. Corn Belt, accurate row-crop systems and tile-drainage representation can significantly impact the water-quality simulation. Existing datasets lack collective classification on crop-rotations and tile-drainage, limiting their spatial representativeness. We developed the 30m-resolution "Tile-drainage and Rotation-Enhanced Cropland" (TREC) dataset for Conterminous United States, integrating both continuous-crop rotations and tile-drainage data. We assessed the performance of TREC against the traditional Cropland Data Layer (CDL) using SWAT + model in two Midwe...

**Authors:** Charan Babu Ankela, Neelima T L, Chandrasekar K, Nidhi Misra, Avil Kumar K et al. (6 authors)
**Journal:** Scientific Reports (2026-01-30)
**DOI:** [10.1038/s41598-025-33916-5](https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-025-33916-5)

**Matched Topics:** seasonal, irrigation

**Abstract:**

Evapotranspiration (ET) is a key component of the hydrological cycle and is critical for determining crop water requirements. Accurate ET estimation is essential for improving irrigation efficiency, particularly under increasing water scarcity and climate variability. Conventional approaches such as the soil water balance, empirical formulations, the FAO Penman–Monteith method, eddy covariance flux towers, lysimeters, and scintillometers each have limitations related to spatial representativeness, accuracy, or operational cost. Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) equipped with multispectral and thermal sensors offer a high spatial resolution and cost-effective alternative for field-scale assessment of surface energy balance components and ET. In this study, a field experiment was conducted on ...

**Matched Topics:** irrigation

**Abstract:**

Real-time sensors for precision irrigation schedulating are used for enhancing water efficiency and optimizing resource usage. Poor resource management can negatively impact traditional farming practices, particularly in regions limited by water shortages. Agriculture is susceptible due to its heavy reliance on water resources. Due to global warming and its potential impacts, there is a growing emphasis on developing strategies to ensure a steady water supply for food production and consumption. As a result, research on reducing water usage in irrigation systems needs to be implemented. While traditional commercial irrigation sensors are often too expensive for smaller farms to adopt, manufacturers are now producing affordable alternatives that can be integrated with network systems to pro...
