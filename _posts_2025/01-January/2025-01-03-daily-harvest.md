### Machine learning for improved seasonal forecasting of precipitation over East Africa

**Authors:** Jane Smith, John Doe, Alice Johnson et al. (8 authors)
**Journal:** Nature Water ⭐ (2025-01-03)
**DOI:** [10.1038/s44221-024-00123-4](https://doi.org/10.1038/s44221-024-00123-4)

**Matched Topics:** seasonal, precipitation, hydrology
**Matched Fields:** environmental science, computer science

**Abstract:**

Seasonal precipitation forecasting is critical for water resource management and agricultural planning in East Africa. Here we develop a machine learning framework that combines climate model outputs with satellite observations to improve forecast skill. Our approach achieves a 35% improvement over traditional dynamical models for 3-month lead times. We demonstrate the application to reservoir operations and irrigation scheduling in the Lake Victoria basin. The framework is generalizable to other regions with limited in-situ observations.

**LLM Assessment:** Relevant (confidence: 0.95) - Directly addresses seasonal forecasting for water management

### Reservoir sedimentation impacts on hydropower generation under climate change

**Authors:** Bob Zhang, Carol White, David Lee
**Journal:** Nature Climate Change ⭐ (2025-01-03)
**DOI:** [10.1038/s41558-024-02234-5](https://doi.org/10.1038/s41558-024-02234-5)

**Matched Topics:** reservoir, hydropower, climate change
**Matched Fields:** environmental science, engineering

**Abstract:**

Reservoir sedimentation reduces storage capacity and affects hydropower generation, but projections under climate change remain uncertain. Using a global database of 500+ large reservoirs, we project sediment accumulation rates under RCP4.5 and RCP8.5 scenarios. Results show 15-40% reduction in storage capacity by 2100, with cascading effects on energy production. We identify hotspots in Southeast Asia and South America where adaptation strategies are urgently needed.

**LLM Assessment:** Relevant (confidence: 0.92) - Combines reservoir operations with climate impacts

### Improving MOSART river routing with sub-grid topographic corrections

**Authors:** Emily Rodriguez, Frank Chen, Grace Park
**Journal:** Water Resources Research (2025-01-03)
**DOI:** [10.1029/2024WR035678](https://doi.org/10.1029/2024WR035678)

**Matched Topics:** river, hydrologic model, runoff
**Matched Fields:** engineering, environmental science

**Abstract:**

The MOSART river routing model represents sub-grid topography using simplified parameterizations that may introduce biases in runoff delivery timing. We develop a novel approach using high-resolution DEM derivatives to correct hillslope routing at the sub-grid scale. Validation against USGS streamflow observations shows 20% improvement in timing metrics and reduced bias in peak flows. The method is computationally efficient and suitable for global-scale Earth system models.

### Flash flood early warning using deep learning and radar rainfall

**Authors:** Henry Liu, Isabel Martinez, Jake Anderson et al. (6 authors)
**Journal:** Journal of Hydrology (2025-01-03)
**DOI:** [10.1016/j.jhydrol.2024.131567](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jhydrol.2024.131567)

**Matched Topics:** flood, rainfall, hydrology

**Abstract:**

Flash floods pose significant risks in mountainous regions with limited lead time for warnings. We present a deep learning framework that ingests real-time radar rainfall and terrain features to predict flash flood occurrence 1-3 hours in advance. Testing on 50 historical events achieves 85% hit rate with 15% false alarm rate. The system has been operationalized in three watersheds in Colorado.

### Drought impacts on groundwater-surface water exchange in agricultural regions

**Authors:** Karen Williams, Leo Thompson
**Journal:** Journal of Hydrology (2025-01-03)
**DOI:** [10.1016/j.jhydrol.2024.131568](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jhydrol.2024.131568)

**Matched Topics:** drought, surface water, irrigation

**Abstract:**

Groundwater pumping for irrigation intensifies during droughts, but impacts on stream depletion are poorly quantified. Using a coupled groundwater-surface water model calibrated to Central Valley observations, we show that drought-driven pumping reduces streamflow by 30-60% compared to normal years. Recovery timescales exceed 5 years even after drought termination. Results highlight the need for conjunctive management strategies.
