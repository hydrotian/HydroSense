# HydroSense - Intelligent Paper Harvesting

Welcome to HydroSense, an automated literature tracking system for hydrology and water resources research.

## About

HydroSense automatically monitors publications from top-tier and high-impact journals in hydrology, climate science, and earth system modeling. Papers are classified using a three-tier priority system:

- **Daily Reports**: Papers published each day, organized by relevance
- **Monthly Summaries**: Curated highlights and trends from each month

## Organization

Reports are organized chronologically:
- **2025** → **January** → Daily reports (Jan 1, Jan 2, etc.)

- Author names
- Journal names
- Keywords and topics
- Paper titles
- Abstract content
